i used this project to exploring making a discord bot for fun. i ended on creating three slash commands: "hello world", "tts", and "rtu". 
hello world: simply replies with "hello world" to the user that used the command
tts: if enabled, reads message out loud using TTS
rtu: (my favorite) moves selected used to a random channel in the discord server 'x' amount of times.
currently only the "rtu" commands is active if you are to pull down the code. to enable the other commands go to the 'bot.js' file and uncomment/restructure the if-statement on lines 37-45
